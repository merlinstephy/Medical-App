**Objective**
 To create a Python application that provides information about medicines including uses, dosage, composition, and side effects.
 To detect age-wise risks associated with medicine consumption.
 To provide a user-friendly interface for easy access to medicine information.
**Project Overview**
Built using Python and Tkinter for GUI.
 Data stored in Excel files, read using pandas.
 Features include:
        - Search medicine by name
        - Display composition, dosage, and side effects
        - Check age-specific risks (child, adult, senior)
         - Simple GUI interface with buttons for navigation
**Code Explanation:**
 Tkinter GUI: Buttons, Labels, Entry widgets for interaction
Pandas: Reading Excel data and filtering based on user input
 Risk Detection: Logic implemented using conditional statements based on age groups
 Error Handling: Checks if medicine is not found in the dataset
**Result:**
 Medicine information displayed successfully in the GUI
 Age-wise risk alerts shown accurately
 Example:
   - Medicine: Paracetamol Syrup
   - Age Group: Child
   - Risk: Safe at recommended dosage
